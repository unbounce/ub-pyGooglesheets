# ub-pyGooglesheets
Write data to google sheets from python

1. Install on pyGooglesheets in sense: 
  `pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/unbounce/ub-pyGooglesheets.git`
2. (Optional Step if you want to use in your own dev environment): Create a Google Service Account which is an account that doesnâ€™t launch a browser and supports server-to-server interactions. The link can be found at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount
  Ensure that your project in Google is enabled to allow server-to-server integration
3. (If you do not want to create a Google Service Account) get `service-account.json` from Last Pass in the "Shared-Data Chapter folder": Just copy the everything between (and including) the `{ ... }` in "Sense Service Account"
4. Paste the contents into file named service_account.json and put in sense console. Good practice is to have path `data/service_account.json` and copy that path (this has already been done in `ub-data-hub`.
5. Enter Google Service Account credentials from Step 2(dev) or Step 3(dev or prod) into their respective fields in the `service_account.json` file and save
6. Share Google Sheets with the value of  the `client_email` attribute in the `service_account.json`

Sample Python Script:
    # Write out to spreadsheet
    import pygooglesheets
    data = Snapshot_TotalConversionStats_ForAllTime_AsNow.toPandas()
    credentials = 'data/pyGooglesheets/service_account.json'
    connection = pygooglesheets.Connection(credentials=credentials,
      permissions="readwrite")
    spreadsheet = pygooglesheets.Spreadsheet(
      '1FB53mvTmJmS_EM9rJwfZchkiKrKwf5WPBo7SewoTG54')
    spreadsheet.update(connection, "conversions!A1:F2", numpy.vstack((data.keys(), data.values)))

`data` - dataframe in python derived (hiveSQL, etc)

`credentials` - your path to the `service_account.json` file saved in Step 6

`connection` - call to pygooglesheets connection function passing credentials and permissions (readwrite or w used for writing which is the only function at the moment)

spreadsheet - call to Spreadsheet function passing the Google Sheets Id associated with the document you want to write to. Ensure that Step 6 is complete. The ID is the value between the "/d/" and the "/edit" in the URL of your spreadsheet
